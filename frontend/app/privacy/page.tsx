Payment providers and other processors act on documented instructions or under their own notices where they are independent controllers."

      "• Vendor registration, verification, order fulfilment tools, and settlement records",

For vendors, we collect onboarding business specs, price lists, and compliance documents.",
      "Data generated through use: order status history, approximate live location of the delivery person while active tracking is on, device diagnostic logs, and security signals like failed login attempts.",
      "Data from payment providers: confirmation of payment status, transaction references, and amount. We do not store full card PAN or CVV numbers on FlameIntel databases.",

      "Refill estimates use information you supply (such as cylinder size and household context) and your order or refill history. They are software estimates, not measurements from a sensor on your cylinder. You remain responsible for monitoring your gas supply for safety.",
